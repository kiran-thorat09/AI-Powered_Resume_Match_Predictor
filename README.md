# AI-Powered Resume Match Predictor

An end-to-end deep learning project that predicts how well a candidate's resume matches a job description using Sentence-BERT embeddings. This tool provides clear match scores and recommendations, with an interactive Streamlit interface and Excel logging for shortlisted candidates.



## Features

- **Semantic Similarity Scoring:** Leverages Sentence-BERT (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to compute cosine similarity between resume text and job description.
- **PDF Resume Parsing:** Extracts resume text and candidate details (name, email, phone) automatically using PyMuPDF and regular expressions.
- **Interactive Web App:** Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use interface to upload resumes, input job descriptions, and view results instantly.
- **Excel Logging:** Automatically saves information of candidates with partial or strong matches into an Excel file (`shortlisted_candidates.xlsx`).
